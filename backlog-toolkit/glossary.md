# Glossary

Definitions of terms used in this backlog management package.

## Agile & Scrum Terms

### Acceptance Criteria
Specific, testable conditions that must be met for a backlog item to be considered complete. Written from the user's perspective.

### Backlog
A prioritized list of work items (features, bugs, tasks) that need to be completed. See also: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog.

### Backlog Refinement
A recurring meeting where the team reviews, clarifies, estimates, and prioritizes backlog items. Also called backlog grooming.

### Burndown Chart
A visual representation of work remaining over time, used to track sprint progress.

### Epic
A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Epics typically span multiple sprints.

### Fibonacci Sequence
A sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...) used for story point estimation to force meaningful size differences.

### Product Backlog
The complete, prioritized list of all work items for the product. Managed by the Product Owner.

### Product Owner
The person responsible for managing the product backlog, prioritizing work, and ensuring the team delivers value.

### Scrum Master
The person responsible for facilitating Scrum processes, removing blockers, and helping the team improve.

### Sprint
A time-boxed period (typically 1-3 weeks) during which a team works on a set of backlog items.

### Sprint Backlog
The subset of product backlog items selected for a specific sprint.

### Sprint Goal
A clear, measurable objective for a sprint that guides the team's work.

### Sprint Planning
A meeting at the start of a sprint where the team selects backlog items and breaks them down into tasks.

### Sprint Retrospective
A meeting at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved.

### Sprint Review
A meeting at the end of a sprint where the team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders.

### Story Points
A unit of measure for estimating the relative effort, complexity, and risk of backlog items. Uses Fibonacci sequence.

### User Story
A short description of a feature from the user's perspective, following the format: "As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [benefit]."

### Velocity
The average number of story points a team completes per sprint. Used for capacity planning.

## Backlog Management Terms

### Backlog Item
A single entry in the backlog, such as a feature request or bug fix.

### Bug Fix
A backlog item that addresses a defect, error, or unexpected behavior in the product.

### Feature Request
A backlog item that describes a new feature or enhancement to be added to the product.

### Priority
The relative importance of a backlog item, typically categorized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.

### Status
The current state of a backlog item in its lifecycle (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

### Story Points
A relative measure of effort, complexity, and risk for backlog items. Uses Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).

## Template Terms

### Template
A structured document format used to create consistent backlog items. Contains sections and placeholders.

### Template Metadata
Information about a template, such as version, last updated date, and compatibility.

### Validation Checklist
A list of criteria that must be met before a backlog item is considered complete and ready.

## Process Terms

### Backlog Lifecycle
The progression of a backlog item through different statuses: Not Started → In Progress → Completed.

### Cycle Time
The total time from when a backlog item is created until it is completed.

### Dependency
A relationship where one backlog item must be completed before another can be started.

### Estimation
The process of assigning story points to backlog items based on effort, complexity, and risk.

### Prioritization
The process of ordering backlog items by importance, value, urgency, or other criteria.

### Refinement
The process of reviewing, clarifying, and improving backlog items to make them ready for sprint planning.

## Technical Terms

### Acceptance Criteria
Specific, testable conditions that must be met for a backlog item to be considered complete.

### Technical Reference
A link or reference to specific code locations, classes, methods, or documentation related to a backlog item.

### Root Cause
The underlying reason why a bug or issue occurs, identified through investigation and analysis.

### Solution
The approach or implementation used to fix a bug or implement a feature.

## Status Terms

### Not Started (⭕)
A backlog item that has been created but work has not yet begun.

### In Progress (⏳)
A backlog item that is currently being worked on, typically assigned to an active sprint.

### Completed (✅)
A backlog item that has been finished, tested, and verified as complete.

## Priority Terms

### Critical (🔴)
Highest priority. Blocks core functionality, security issues, or data loss. Must be addressed immediately.

### High (🟠)
High priority. Important features or significant user impact. Should be addressed soon (next 1-2 sprints).

### Medium (🟡)
Medium priority. Nice to have features with moderate value. Can wait for future sprints.

### Low (🟢)
Low priority. Future considerations with low user value. Can be deferred indefinitely.

## File & Directory Terms

### Feature Requests Directory
The directory containing individual feature request files (e.g., `backlog/feature-requests/`).

### Bug Fixes Directory
The directory containing individual bug fix files (e.g., `backlog/bug-fixes/`).

### Sprints Directory
The directory containing sprint planning documents (e.g., `sprints/`).

### Product Backlog File
The main backlog table file that tracks all feature requests and bug fixes (e.g., `product-backlog.md`).

## ID Format Terms

### ID Format
The pattern used for unique identifiers (e.g., FR-XXX, BF-XXX, FEAT-XXX).

### Feature Request ID
Unique identifier for a feature request (e.g., FR-042).

### Bug Fix ID
Unique identifier for a bug fix (e.g., BF-015).

## Estimation Terms

### Story Point Estimation
The process of assigning story points to backlog items based on relative effort, complexity, and risk.

### Fibonacci Estimation
Using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) for story point estimation to force meaningful size differences.

### Relative Sizing
Comparing backlog items to each other rather than estimating absolute time, to determine story points.

### Task Breakdown
The process of breaking down a user story into smaller, actionable tasks that can be completed in 1-2 days.

## Documentation Terms

### Cross-Reference
A link from one document to another, used to connect related backlog items, templates, or documentation.

### Template Catalog
A reference guide that helps users select the appropriate template for their needs.

### Quick Reference
A cheat sheet with common information, such as status values, priority levels, and story point guides.

### Examples
Filled-out template examples that demonstrate best practices and show how to use templates effectively.
